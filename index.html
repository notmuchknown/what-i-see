                This is a book that is a good introduction to thinking about our relationship with money differently. 
                <p>I'd start with this one. <br> Usually in public libraries </p>

        <li>This book is a story of a man who got to experience two different ways of interacting with money in his childhood. 
          This formative experience was central in his outlook on life and earning. 
          <p>I don't agree with everything he says, but I do think he has a lot of useful points. I also think the viewpoints are worth hearing for a diversification of understanding. 
          As you read the book remember to contrast with a moralistic viewpoint.    </p> </li>

          The link takes you to the blog site. It has just about everything the book does. 
          The book is decently hard to find, your best bet if you want to read a hard copy is to order it from a library 
          <br>The PDF is available on LibGen(Will try to add in a link later) 
            <p>This book is a fairly comprehensive and indepth exploration of the nuts and bolts of how to achieve financial independence. 
              <br>Would not reccomend to start with this book, and it's not a must read unless you really are interested in the idea. 
              It is in some ways it is the seminal book for FI-RE
